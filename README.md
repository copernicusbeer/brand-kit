Copernicus brand assets and official logos.

## Logo Do's and Don'ts

As Copernicus Beer DAO we have a strict policy of the use of logos and expression of the brand. This is because we believe it benefits the value of the brand.

Shown below are examples for how you _should_ and _should not_ use our brand logos.

- Don't manipulate and stretch the logo.
- Don't use other font weights.
- Don't type out the logo in other fonts.
- Don't rotate the logo
- Don't add gradients or effects
- Don't place the logos on busy areas.
